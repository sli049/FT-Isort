# FT-Isort

stl_algo.h: implemented the fault injection and compute 3 times of checksums to protect the array from memory errors.
stl_heap.h: implemented the fault injection.
The above 2 files together implemented:
1. Fault tolerant instrosort protected by aggressive protection with and/or without memory protection.
Plus another file, correct_only.h which implemented Algorithm 5 in our paper, all the 3 files together implemented:
1. and 2. Fault tolerant introsort protected by aggressive protection with and/or without memory protection.

To test the fault tolerant introsot:

1. Install gcc-7.1.0 and replace /include/c++/7.1.0/bits/stl_algo.h and stl_heap.h with our modifed ones.
2. Run the program, test_ft_isort.cpp, to test different protection methods.

Thank you very much!
